                    Developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for handwritten equation recognition using 
                    <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sagyamthapa/handwritten-math-symbols/code" target="_blank">Handwritten Math Symbols</a> 
                     dataset.
                    Leveraged TensorFlow to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN), achieving 99% test
                    accuracy in digit
                    and symbol classification. Utilized OpenCV (CV2) for image preprocessing and segmentation to isolate
                    individual
                    characters from handwritten input. Integrated Python-based automation with the Wolfram Alpha API to
                    interpret
                    predicted characters and return computed solutions, enabling dynamic equation solving. This project
                    demonstrates
                    strong expertise in deep learning, computer vision, model optimization, and cloud-integrated API
                    services.

                    Analyzed a dataset with nearly 6,500 observations and 100+ predictors. Applied Feature Engineering
                    concepts to
                    enhance dimensionality reduction and optimize data representation. 
                    Implemented KNN clustering and utilized
                    various machine learning models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme
                    Gradient
                    Boosting (XGBoost), achieving a highest accuracy of 62%. The project focused on identifying the most
                    relevant
                    predictors of fight outcomes and refining prediction pipelines through experimentation and
                    optimization. This Project was supervised by

                    Developed a comprehensive language learning mobile app tailored for foreign immigrants aiming to
                    improve their
                    English proficiency and integrate into American culture. 
                    This project was supervised by <a href="https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/figueira-silvia/" target="_blank">Dr. Silvia Figueira</a>,
                    as a part of the 2023 SCU/Ohlone College Summer Internship Program.
                    The app features a personalized English
                    learning
                    curriculum, daily challenges, and real-time tracking. Using Figma, an intuitive and user-friendly
                    interface was
                    designed. The application was built using Flutter and Dart, ensuring cross-platform compatibility
                    and a seamless
                    user experience. Firebase was integrated to deliver personalized daily challenges, motivating
                    consistent learning
                    and practice while tracking progress over time.

                <p>
                    This report dives into and evaluates long-term investment strategies for a trust aiming to support
                    annual
                    spending while maintaining purchasing power over 30 years. Various portfolio allocations and
                    spending rates were
                    analyzed through simulations, focusing on real returns, downside risk, and capital sustainability.
                    The analysis
                    considered inflation-adjusted performance, sequence of return risk, and long-term capital
                    preservation under
                    different economic scenarios.

                    Contributed as a software developer for Project DIANA, building custom UAV software to detect and
                    map gas
                    concentrations in real time. The mission is to protect endangered species and biodiversity by
                    reducing harmful
                    gas emissions such as nitrogen gas in surrounding environments. Received a technology grant for
                    high-tech drones,
                    which were equipped with Grove AQI sensors to monitor air quality. Input data was processed using
                    Arduino
                    systems to interpret real-time atmospheric readings across wide areas, enabling actionable insights
                    for
                    conservation efforts.
