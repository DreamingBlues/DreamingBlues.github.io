                    Developed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for handwritten equation recognition using

                    dataset.
                    Leveraged TensorFlow to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN), achieving 99% test
                    accuracy in digit and symbol classification. Utilized OpenCV (CV2) for image preprocessing and
                    segmentation to isolate individual characters from handwritten input. Integrated Python-based
                    automation with the Wolfram Alpha API to interpret predicted characters and return computed
                    solutions, enabling dynamic equation solving. The project highlights expertise in deep learning,
                    computer vision, model optimization, and cloud-integrated API services.

                    Analyzed a dataset containing nearly 6,500 observations and over 100 predictors to identify key
                    factors influencing fight outcomes. Applied feature engineering techniques to enhance dimensionality
                    reduction and optimize data representation. Implemented K-Means clustering and evaluated multiple
                    machine learning models including: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Extreme Gradient
                    Boosting (XGBoost), achieving a peak accuracy of 62%. The project emphasized predictor relevance and
                    iterative refinement of the prediction pipeline through experimentation and performance
                    optimization. This Project was supervised by

                    This project was supervised by <a href="https://www.scu.edu/engineering/faculty/figueira-silvia/"
                        target="_blank">Dr. Silvia Figueira</a>, as part of the 2023 SCU/Ohlone College Summer
                    Internship Program. Together with a partner, we developed a mobile app featuring a personalized
                    English learning curriculum, daily challenges, and real-time progress tracking. Using Figma, we
                    designed an intuitive and user-friendly interface to enhance accessibility and engagement. The app
                    was built with Flutter and Dart, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and a seamless user
                    experience. We integrated Firebase to deliver tailored daily challenges, encouraging consistent
                    learning while tracking individual progress over time.

                    I contributed as a software developer for Project DIANA, where we built custom UAV software to
                    detect and map gas concentrations in real time. Our mission was to protect endangered species and
                    preserve biodiversity by reducing harmful emissions like nitrogen gas in vulnerable ecosystems. We
                    secured a technology grant to acquire advanced drones equipped with Grove AQI sensors for air
                    quality monitoring. I helped process atmospheric data using Arduino systems, enabling real-time
                    interpretation across wide areas and generating actionable insights for environmental conservation.

                    This report evaluates long-term investment strategies for a trust designed to support annual
                    spending while preserving purchasing power over a 30-year horizon. Simulations were conducted across
                    various portfolio allocations and spending rates, with a focus on real returns, downside risk, and
                    capital sustainability. The analysis incorporates inflation-adjusted performance, sequence-of-return
                    risk, and long-term capital preservation under diverse economic scenarios.
