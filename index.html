        Hi, I'm Abtin Olaee. I'm currently pursuing a graduate degree in Data Science at San José State University. Previously, I earned my bachelor's degree in Statistics and Data Science from the University of California, Santa Barbara.
      </p>

      <p>
        My background spans data engineering, database management, and cloud platforms including AWS and GCP. I also have experience in mathematical modeling and predictive analytics, with a focus on building systems that support effective human-computer interaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        My current interests lie in <strong>recursive neural networks, deep reinforcement, and reinforcement learning</strong>, and how they can be used to develop practical AI solutions that bridge academic research and real-world impact.
