            <img src="picture.jpg" alt="Abtin Olaee" class="bio-pic" />
            <p>I am pursuing a graduate degree in Data Research to strengthen my ability to apply data-driven methods to
                real-world problems. My background includes data engineering, database management, and experience with both
                AWS and GCP. I have a strong foundation in mathematical modeling, machine learning, and predictive
                analytics, with a focus on building systems that support human-computer interaction. Iâ€™m especially
                interested in advancing my skills in Recursive Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning to develop
                practical AI solutions that connect research and real-world impact.
